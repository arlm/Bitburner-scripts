# Bitburner-scripts

This is my repository of [Bitburner](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner) scripts. They are written using the in-game language of NetscriptJS, which is a mutation of Javascript.

This repository uses the VisualStudio Code extensions showed on this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitburner/comments/bh48y2/visual_studio_code_ram_calculator_extra/https://https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitburner/comments/bh48y2/visual_studio_code_ram_calculator_extra/). There are copies inside the extensions directory.

## Requirements

The script has been modified to be able to start on 8 GB (the default starting RAM for a player) on the `home` server. Obviously, when you expand the memory available, you'll get extra perks - being able to buy and manage player-owned servers, as well as using spare RAM to do actions.

The script can be slow to get going, but it'll get there eventually. Getting access to more port hackers will improve the performance.
